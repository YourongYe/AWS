# AWS Availability Zones
- Each region has  many  availability  zones (usually  3,  min  is  2,  max  is  6).  
- Each availability  zone  (AZ)  is  one  or  more discrete  data  centers  with  redundant  power, networking,  and  connectivity
- They’re  separate  from  each  other,  so  that they’re  isolated  from  disasters
- They’re  connected  with  high  bandwidth, ultra-low  latency  networking

- Root  account created  by  default,  shouldn’t  be  used  or  shared
- Users or Groupscan be assigned JSON documents called policies. These policies define the permissionsof the users
